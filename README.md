# 6/49 Lottery Predictions

The purpose if this project is to contribute to the development of a mobile app that aims to help users better estimate their chances of winning the [6/49 Lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49). 

Using historical data from the [national 6/49 lottery game in Canada](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset), I calculate probabilities allowing users to answer questions like:

- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?
