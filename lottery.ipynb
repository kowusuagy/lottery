    "# 6/49 Lottery Mobile App\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose if this project is to contribute to the development of a mobile app that aims to **help users better estimate their chances of winning the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. Users of the app will be able to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will consider historical data from the [national 6/49 lottery game in Canada](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) which has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018."
